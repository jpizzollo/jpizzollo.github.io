Used transcripts of podcast episodes, I performed natural language processing and latent dirichlet allocation modeling to identify common topics. By examining topic distribution at the level of entire episodes I was able to categorize episodes by type and identify trends over time related to particlar topics. Parsing text into 5-minute segments enabled characterization of show structure, identifying common themes between episodes and how topics combine during conversation.
