Heart rate variability (HRV) informs about levels of stress and recovery and can be measured using devices such as a smartwatch or wristband heart rate monitor. Here, I used data from a research study that collected heart rate data and physical activity levels for study participants over the course of 24 hours to build a classification model that distinguishes between stressful and restful activities and a model that identifies disturbances during sleep.

Using transcripts of podcast episodes, I performed natural language processing and latent dirichlet allocation modeling to identify common topics. By examining topic distribution at the level of entire episodes I was able to categorize episodes by type and identify trends over time related to particular topics. Parsing text into 5-minute segments enabled characterization of show structure, identifying common themes between episodes and how topics combine during conversation.
